<b>Setup: run 'npm install' from the project root directory</b>

To run the development server, run 'npm run start' from the project root directory. This will start a Webpack Dev Server instance. If your browser doesn't open automatically, browse to http://localhost:8080.

To build the project, run 'npm run build' from the project root directory. This will create a 'build' folder containing the bundled code. Once this is complete, open 'build/index.html' in a browser.
